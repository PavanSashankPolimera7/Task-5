## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using visual and statistical techniques. It helps in understanding data patterns, spotting anomalies, checking assumptions, and selecting features.

## Key EDA Techniques:
sns.pairplot()
Plots pairwise relationships between numerical columns and can show class-wise separation using the hue parameter.

sns.heatmap()
Displays a matrix of correlations (or any 2D data) using color intensities. Useful to understand relationships and multicollinearity.

Histogram:
Show the distribution of a single numerical variable. Helps detect skewness, outliers, and frequency of values.

Boxplot:
Summarize the distribution, median, and identify outliers. Great for comparing distributions across categories.

Scatterplot:
Show the relationship between two numerical variables. Useful to detect correlations, clusters, and trends.
